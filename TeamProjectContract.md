**Team Contract (ID:** **a38457c0-b5ac-4ba4-8ddb-8076e4e04971)**

**Communication**

1. **Team Meetings**
  1. We will be meeting as a group in the Grainger Library or over Discord every Friday afternoon at a time best for us each week. We expect our meetings to last approximately 1 hour. We will be rotating a note taker for every week and start with the team member&#39;s last name being the earliest in the alphabet. All individuals are expected to attend the weekly meetings, and those unable to attend are expected to read the notes from the team meetings and ask any questions they may have regarding meetings.
2. **Assistance**
  1. Each team member will be contacted through Discord, more specifically our group chat within discord. Individuals are expected to respond within a period of 24 hours, barring extenuating circumstances. In the event that discord does not work, team members will be contacted through email instead.
3. **Respect**
  1. Team members are encouraged to present new ideas and innovations in the localized group chat. Furthermore, other team members are expected to explore and seriously consider each new idea. The title of &quot;Leader&quot; is bestowed upon the person who is the note taker for the week. At each meeting, a team member may present a new innovation. Ideally, unanimous or Â¾ agreement is to be desired. In the event of a tie, the Conflict Resolution Action Plan will be consulted.

**Collaboration**

1. **Work Distribution**
  1. Distribution of work will be allocated for the week at each meeting. All team members will be expected to perform the tasks given to them at that meeting. Tasks are to be assigned to each member on the basis of both the individual&#39;s strengths and weaknesses. It will be an equal distribution for each person.
2. **Time Commitment**
  1. Each team member will work according to the tasks given to them at the weekly meeting. No one should have a greater time commitment than the others. 1-4 hrs expected weekly. If certain individuals are unable to satisfy the time commitment due to extenuating circumstances, then the individual is responsible for alerting the rest of the team as early as possible.
3. **Conflict Resolution Action Plan**
  1. Disagreements on ideas will be resolved with a vote. Issues beyond that will be resolved by first having a respectful in-group discussion then by contacting course directors. Notetakers will be chosen on a weekly basis and will break the tie.
